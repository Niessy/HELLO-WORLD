## BIO ##
*My name is Niessy, and I'm attending Ivy Tech to get my Associate in Applied Science for Software Development. I originally chose Cloud Tech but decided to pursue SoftDev instead. I'm a mother who loves to game in my free time. XBOX GANG for now until I build my PC. :smile: I'm very excited for this new journey and look forward to what's ahead!* :grin:
